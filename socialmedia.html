								The current U18 age group has never really experienced a time without social media. Even
								if they didn't have an account themselves, everyone around them was on and using it.
								Now, however, the age in which kids get their first social media account is decreasing.
								In fact, one study determined that about 50% of kids have social media by the age of 12,
								with the average age being 11 years old.<sup><a href="index.html/#link1">[1]</a></sup>
								The Pew Research Center conducted a survey on March 7th to April 10th in 2018 that asked
								about what social media teens aged 13-17 use. Snapchat, YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook
								were found to be the most popular social media networks that teens use. 35% say they use
								Snapchat most often, 32% say YouTube, 15% say Instagram, and 10% say Facebook is the
								platform they use the most.<sup><a href="index.html/#link10">[10]</a></sup> Other
								popular media that were not listed (or didn't exist yet) are Twitter and TikTok. Lastly,
								although not considered social media, video games are another popular platform that the
								U18 group connect with each other on.
