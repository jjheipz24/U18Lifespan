								<h3>What Social Media Does the U18 Group Use?</h3>

								The current U18 age group has never really experienced a time without social media. Even
								if they didn't have an account themselves, everyone around them was on and using it.
								Now, however, the age in which kids get their first social media account is decreasing.
								In fact, one study determined that about 50% of kids have social media by the age of 12,
								with the average age being 11 years old.<sup><a href="index.html/#link1">[1]</a></sup>
								The Pew Research Center conducted a survey on March 7th to April 10th in 2018 that asked
								about what social media teens aged 13-17 use. Snapchat, YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook
								were found to be the most popular social media networks that teens use. 35% say they use
								Snapchat most often, 32% say YouTube, 15% say Instagram, and 10% say Facebook is the
								platform they use the most.<sup><a href="index.html/#link10">[10]</a></sup> Other
								popular media that were not listed (or didn't exist yet) are Twitter and TikTok. Lastly,
								although not considered social media, video games are another popular platform that the
								U18 group connect with each other on.

								<h3>The Benefits of Social Media for U18</h3>

							<p>
								One large benefit of using social media, not just for U18, is the connectedness that it
								provides. It helps people stay in contact with in-person ties and can even grow existing
								friendships. In the study mentioned above, 31% of teens said that they've experienced
								positive effects from social media; 40% of those said it was attributed to staying in
								touch and interacting via TMC.<sup><a href="index.html/#link10">[10]</a></sup> In fact,
								teens actually spend a majority of their time interacting with their friends with TMC
								than they do in-person (excluding in school). 55% of teens say they text their friends
								daily, 79% say they instant message their friends every day, and 72% say they spend time
								with friends on social media.<sup><a href="index.html/#link14">[14]</a></sup> In many
								cases, TMC is the way many teens receive support from their friends, which helps bring
								them closer. As discussed in relationship development with TMC, self-disclosures tend to
								lead to increased feelings of closeness. Teens often use social media to share aspects
								about their lives with their friends. It was found that 70-83% of teens believed that
								social media helped them feel closer to their friends' lives and feelings.<sup><a
										href="index.html/#link14">[14]</a></sup> As a result of gaining insight on
								what's going on in their friends' lives, teens are able to provide support. In addition
								to the percentage of teens who learned more about their friends from social media, 68%
								of teens have had people supporting them through tough times via TMC on social
								media.<sup><a href="index.html/#link14">[14]</a></sup>

							<p>Along a similar vein, social media has helped teens make new friends. Research showed
								that 57% of 13-17 year old teens who use social media made a new friend online, with
								only 20% actually meeting those friends offline.<sup><a
										href="index.html/#link14">[14]</a></sup>The platforms that seem to be used the
								most in making new friends online are Instagram, Facebook, and video gamesâ€”video games
								only being used by 36% of participants vs. the 64% for Instagram and/or Facebook.<sup><a
										href="index.html/#link14">[14]</a></sup> Video games are, however, the primary
								way that many boys make friends online.<sup><a href="index.html/#link14">[14]</a></sup>
								These friendships, which are often formed because of common identities in shared online
								groups, influence people to feel more comfortable expressing themselves. The relative
								anonymity provided by some online platforms gives teens a feeling of safety and security
								they wouldn't otherwise have in face-to-face communication. In a survey done, 25% of
								teens said they felt less shy, 28% said they felt more outgoing, and 20% said they felt
								more confident (with 53% of those teens identifying as somewhat shy or a lot shy in
								general).<sup><a href="index.html/#link12">[12]</a></sup></p>

								<h3>The Darkside of Social Media</h3>

							<img class="img-left" src="images/dislike.jpg" alt="gray background with thumbs down icon">
							<p>As many parents tell their teenagers, TMC that comes with social media can be extremely
								harmful, especially with teenagers. With all of the social influencers that flood social
								media, it can be difficult not to suffer from FOMO (fear of missing out). For teens, 15%
								of them say that social media makes them have a distorted view of reality and other
								peoples' lives.<sup><a href="index.html/#link10">[10]</a></sup> As a result, many of the
								U18 group members feel pressured to look attractive and popular on social media,
								specifically 40% feel pressured to only post content that makes them look good.<sup><a
										href="index.html/#link14">[14]</a></sup> This is extremely harmful to identity
								formation in teens. This "ought" and "ideal" self that teens portray can lead some to
								feel ashamed of who they really are. Another large issue for teens with TMC via social
								media is interpersonal conflicts. 68% of teenagers have seen drama on social media, with
								15-17 year olds seeing it more frequently than 13-14 year olds (74% vs. 62%).<sup><a
										href="index.html/#link13">[13]</a></sup> Often this drama is stirred up because
								of something that happened in person at school, which then gets carried into a digital
								platform; the
								reverse happens as well. The lack of cues online increases the chances of
								miscommunication and is usually the culprit of many disputes between teens. It was
								found that 26% of teens fought with a friend over something that happened online or
								because of a text.<sup><a href="index.html/#link13">[13]</a></sup> From these conflicts,
								because of the power of social media, teens are able to "end" friendships by
								unfriending, unfollowing, deleting photos, and blocking.<sup><a
										href="index.html/#link13">[13]</a></sup> Social media has now, in a sense, made
								the ending of friendships "definitive."</p>

							<p>A widely talked about issue and something that often occurs from these internet fights is
								cyberbullying. About 54% of teens have witnessed cyberbullying online, with only 35%
								actively stepping in to try to stop it.<sup><a href="index.html/#link15">[15]</a></sup>
