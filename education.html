								<h3>The Evolution of Educational Technology</h3>
							</header>

							<p>Technology in the classroom is not a new concept. Before the year 2000, many classrooms
								had access to radios (1920), overhead projectors (1930),
								ballpoint pens (1940), headphones (1950), videotapes (1951), photocopiers (1959),
								handheld calculators and the Scantron System(1972).<sup><a
										href="index.html#link6">[6]</a></sup>
								After 2000, computers and laptops were introduced, which was a major turning point in
								educational technology. By 2009, 97% of classrooms had at least one computern and 93% of
								classrooms had internet access.<sup><a href="index.html#link6">[6]</a></sup>
								Since then, schools purchased over 23 million devices for classroom use, including iPads
								and Chromebooks, in just 2013 alone.<sup><a href="index.html#link7">[7]</a></sup> Today,
								in 2020, the technology in the classroom extends even beyond just tablets and computers.
								Teachers are now able to use interactive whiteboards and document cameras in the
								classroom to show their material.<sup><a href="index.html#link8">[8]</a></sup>Even
								games, social media, and online learning tools are being utilized to help students feel
								engaged with what is being taught to them.<sup><a href="index.html#link8">[8]</a></sup>

								<h3>The Benefits of Classroom Technology</h3>
							</header>

							<img id="gsuite" class="img-left" src='images/G-Suite-For-Education.png'
								alt="logos for the different G Suite applications surrounding the words 'G Suite for Education'">
							<p>One of the first hopes and achievements that technology has brought to the learning
								environment is better engagements from the students with the materials. Today's students
								are already using technology, so bringing it into an educational setting is not a
								difficult transition and actually makes both the student and the teacher more interested
								in the topic.<sup><a href="index.html#link4">[4]</a></sup>On top of that, there is an
								abundance of online educational resources to assist with learning. Open Educational
								Resources (OER) are defined as, "resources online that are licensed to be freely used,
								revised, and shared," which the US Department of Education is pushing to be used over
								textbooks.<sup><a href="index.html/#link7">[7]</a></sup> Khan Academy,
								YouTube, and Quizlet are just a few examples of other online educational tools that
								provide lessons
								and act as effective study tools to help students succeed.<sup><a
										href="index.html#link5">[5]</a></sup>Additional examples of online tools that
								are
								mentioned in <a
									href="https://www.classcraft.com/blog/features/pros-and-cons-of-technology-in-the-classroom/">this</a>
								article include various things like Google Drive, Google Docs, Google Classroom, Google
								Expeditions, and Slack.<br>With its sharing abilities, the Google Suite lends itself to
								allow for easy collaboration between individuals. For students, this means they can work
								together on assignments and projects outside of the classroom. The <i>Electronic
									Propinquity Theory</i> explains that people feel closeness when they communicate
								with others using TMC, especially when they have no other means of communicating. For
								students, when they leave the classroom, they are limited in how they can interact with
								others to get work done, specifically for partner or group projects. These limitations
								make interactions between students via TMC a more enjoyable experience and builds a
								community that may mimic or exceed the kind of community developed in the classroom.

							<img class="img-right" src="images/online-learning.jpg"
								alt="A graphic depicting traditional learning graphics like books and a physical diploma and cap and online learning like computers and tablets">
							<p>The creation of online learning and resources completely changed the way students get
								their information and how some students are able to get their entire education. Some
								schools
								offer online programs, while others (known as virtual schools) are completely online.
								The Florida Virtual High School, the Utah Electronic High School, and the North Carolina
								Virtual Public High School are just a few schools that are exclusively online.<sup><a
										href="index.html/#link3">[3]</a></sup> Students also have the option of
								attending a school that participates in blended learning, which combines in-person and
								online education. According to some research, Florida had almost 45,000 students in
								grades 6-12 taking classes online from the Virtual School.<sup><a
										href="index.html/#link4">[4]</a></sup>These online options especially benefit
								smaller and rural schools, who can't afford many teachers to teach certain subjects, to
								be able to use video conferencing and web resources to educate their students.<sup><a
										href="index.html/#link4">[4]</a></sup>For students with disabilities, having
								these online options, along
								with assistive technology, allows for more equality with learning. Students with
								disabilities are able to learn at their own pace and even get content personalized to
								help them succeed.<sup><a href="index.html/#link7">[7]</a></sup><sup><a
										href="index.html/#link8">[8]</a></sup> In this way, the <i>Social Presence
									Theory</i> can be seen in how online learning gives some students more feelings of
								being present in their classes because they are able to learn more effectively alongside
								their peers than they would in person.

								alt="graphic of a paper in front of a laptop">
							<p>Although controversial, there have been mixed findings when it comes to the effects of
								TMC on test taking. There is some evidence to support the idea that TMC has improved
								test scores, literacy, and overall outcomes.<sup><a
										href="index.html/#link8">[8]</a></sup> A specific case involves Maine in the
								early 2000s. In 2002 and 2003, Maine distributed over 30,000 computers to 7th and 8th
								graders in public schools.<sup><a href="index.html/#link2">[2]</a></sup> As a result,
								there was an increase in writing scores on standardized tests. In fact, over 49% of 8th
								graders reached proficient in writing on the Maine Education Assessment in 2005.<sup><a
										href="index.html/#link2">[2]</a></sup>. This can be attributed to the fact that
								"laptops make it easier for students to edit their copy and make changes without getting
								writer’s cramp [...] (and) those skills translated when the test was taken with pen and
								paper."<sup><a href="index.html/#link2">[2]</a></sup></p>

								<h3>The Cons of Classroom Technology</h3>

							<img class="img-right" src="images/PARCC.jpg"
								alt="graphic with outlines of students with various learning bubbles above their heads">
							<p>For the drawbacks of educational technology for the U18 group, excessive screen time and
								more distractions have created issues for this younger generation. Some studies have
								discovered that students develop shorter attention spans, which hinders their abilities
								to complete intricate projects.<sup><a href="index.html/#link8">[8]</a></sup> Another
								big issue with educational technology has to do with the unequal access to tech
								resources. Many schools and/or families cannot afford the newer technology that is being
								pushed, and often the schools do not have enough bandwidth to support the amount of
								students needing the internet.<sup><a href="index.html/#link7">[7]</a></sup>
								Additionally, some schools are forced to adopt the new technology, but they don't have
								any plans for how the technology will be integrated into the existing curriculum.<sup><a
										href="index.html/#link7">[7]</a></sup> A final example of a drawback with
								technology in education has to do, once again, with test performance. In 2014 and 2015,
								online exams became popular with 10 states choosing to use exams from the Partnership
								for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers (PARCC) and 18 using exams from the
								Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium.<sup><a href="index.html/#link7">[7]</a></sup> It
								was found that students who took the online PARCC exam did lower, on average, than those
								who did the traditional exam.<sup><a href="index.html/#link9">[9]</a></sup> This can be
								related to the efficacy that students feel with technology. If students feel comfortable
								navigating technology, they are less likely to struggle when it is used in a testing
								format.</p>

								<h3>Example</h3>
							</header>
							<!--Image from https://www.stickpng.com/img/icons-logos-emojis/tech-companies/slack-new-logo-->
							<img id="slack" class="img-left" src="images/slack.png" alt="picture of the slack logo">
							<p>A great example of TMC found in education for the U18 group is through the application
								Slack. Slack is a cross-platform application made for group collaboration. Within the
								application, there is the ability to create channels for specific purposes, group
								messaging, direct messaging, file sharing, voice/video conferencing and more. Many
								teachers, especially high school teachers, have chosen to use Slack for their classes.
								With its many channels (literally), it allows for a more engaging experience to keep the
								students connected to both the class and each other.
								<br><br>
								One of the biggest ways a technology can keep people from feeling present has to do with
								time. The traditional way of communication, specifically with teachers, is usually by
								email. Email is considered an asynchronous form of communication because there is no
								expectation for an immediate response (nor is there usually one). This prevents people
								from feeling present with the technology because they can't talk to a person the same
								way they can face-to-face. Slack, however, acts
								as more of an instant messenger, which turns it into a platform for synchronous
								conversation. If a teacher creates a channel like #discussions, students are able to
								talk to one another in that channel synchronously and in a way that can be comparable to
								the in-class discussions—creating more social presence. This aligns heavily with the
								ideas from the <i>Media Richness Theory</i>, which looks at a mediums ability to allow
								for shared understanding between people in a given time frame. With its powerful video
								conferencing and screen sharing ability, students are able to present their ideas and
								communicate with each other like they would in class if they were giving a presentation
								or having a discussion in class.</p>

								<h3>The Future of TMC in Education for U18</h3>
							</header>
							<p>With all of the technological advancements, educational technology used in schools for
								U18 could potentially integrate augmented and/or virtual reality. For students who learn
								exclusively online, this could change the way they experience their education. It may
								help increase their feelings of presence by allowing them to feel part of and surrounded
								by a physical
								class and classroom.</p>
