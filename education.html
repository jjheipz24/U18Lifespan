								<h3>The Evolution of Educational Technology</h3>
							</header>

							<p>Technology in the classroom is not a new concept. Before the year 2000, many classrooms
								had access to radios (1920), overhead projectors (1930),
								ballpoint pens (1940), headphones (1950), videotapes (1951), photocopiers (1959),
								handheld calculators and the Scantron System(1972).<sup><a
										href="index.html#link6">[6]</a></sup>
								After 2000, computers and laptops were introduced, which was a major turning point in
								educational technology. By 2009, 97% of classrooms had at least one computern and 93% of
								classrooms had internet access.<sup><a href="index.html#link6">[6]</a></sup>
								Since then, schools purchased over 23 million devices for classroom use, including iPads
								and Chromebooks, in just 2013 alone.<sup><a href="index.html#link7">[7]</a></sup> Today,
								in 2020, the technology in the classroom extends even beyond just tablets and computers.
								Teachers are now able to use interactive whiteboards and document cameras in the
								classroom to show their material.<sup><a href="index.html#link8">[8]</a></sup>Even
								games, social media, and online learning tools are being utilized to help students feel
								engaged with what is being taught to them.<sup><a href="index.html#link8">[8]</a></sup>

								<h3>The Benefits of Classroom Technology</h3>

								alt="logos for the different G Suite applications surrounding the words 'G Suite for Education'">
							<p>One of the first hopes and achievements that technology has brought to the learning
								environment is better engagements from the students with the materials. Today's students
								are already using technology, so bringing it into an educational setting is not a
								difficult transition and actually makes both the student and the teacher more interested
								in the topic.<sup><a href="index.html#link4">[4]</a></sup>On top of that, there is an
								abundance of online educational resources to assist with learning. Open Educational
								Resources (OER) are defined as, "resources online that are licensed to be freely used,
								revised, and shared," which the US Department of Education is pushing to be used over
								textbooks.<sup><a href="index.html/#link7">[7]</a></sup> Khan Academy,
								YouTube, and Quizlet are just a few examples of other online educational tools that
								provide lessons
								and act as effective study tools to help students succeed.<sup><a
										href="index.html#link5">[5]</a></sup>Other examples of online tools that are
								mentioned in <a
									href="https://www.classcraft.com/blog/features/pros-and-cons-of-technology-in-the-classroom/">this</a>
								article include various things like Google Drive, Google Docs, Google Classroom, Google
								Expeditions, and Slack.<br>With its sharing abilities, the Google Suite lends itself to
								allow for easy collaboration between individuals. For students, this means they can work
								together on assignments and projects outside of the classroom. The <i>Electronic
									Propinquity Theory</i> explains that people feel closeness when they communicate
								with others using TMC, especially when they have no other means of communicating. For
								students, when they leave the classroom, they are limited in how they can interact with
								others to get work done, specifically for partner or group projects. These limitations
								make interactions between students via TMC a more enjoyable experience and builds a
								community that may mimic or exceed the kind of community developed in the classroom.

							<p>The creation of online learning and resources completely changed the way students get
								their information and how some students are able to get their entire education. Some
								schools
								offer online programs, while others (known as virtual schools) are completely online.
								The Florida Virtual High School, the Utah Electronic High School, and the North Carolina
								Virtual Public High School are just a few schools that are exclusively online.<sup><a
										href="index.html/#link3">[3]</a></sup> Students also have the option of
								attending a school that participates in blended learning, which combines in-person and
								online education. According to some research, Florida had almost 45,000 students in
								grades 6-12 taking classes online from the Virtual School.<sup><a
										href="index.html/#link4">[4]</a></sup>These online options especially benefit
								smaller and rural schools, who can't afford many teachers to teach certain subjects, to
								be able to use video conferencing and web resources to educate their students.<sup><a
										href="index.html/#link4">[4]</a></sup>For students with disabilities, having
								these online options, along
								with assistive technology, allows for more equality with learning. Students with
								disabilities are able to learn at their own pace and even get content personalized to
								help them succeed.<sup><a href="index.html/#link7">[7]</a></sup><sup><a
										href="index.html/#link8">[8]</a></sup> In this way, the <i>Social Presence
									Theory</i> can be seen in how online learning gives some students more feelings of
								being present in their classes because they are able to learn more effectively alongside
								their peers than they would in person.</p>
